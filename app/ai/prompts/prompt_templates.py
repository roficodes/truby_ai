Can be internal (character vs. self), interpersonal (character vs. character), or external (character vs. environment/society/fate).",

Each scene should raise the stakes and deepen the conflict. Characters face increasingly difficult challenges that test their resolve and force them to make harder choices.",
    "CLIMAX": "Peak of the story, typically in the third act. The story's most intense moment where the main conflict reaches its peak. This is the turning point where the protagonist faces their greatest challenge and the outcome of the central conflict is determined. Everything in the story has been building to this moment.",
    "FALLING_ACTION": "End of the story. Immediately after the climax. The events that occur after the climax, showing the immediate consequences of the climactic moment. Loose ends begin to be tied up, and the story moves toward its conclusion. Often brief in screenwriting compared to other forms.",
    "RESOLUTION": "The final outcome where conflicts are resolved and the story concludes. Shows how the characters and their world have changed as a result of the story's events. Provides closure and answers the story's central dramatic question.",

You are analyzing an excerpt from the screenplay "{movie_name}". This is scene number {scene_progress}. 

<START OF EXCERPT>
{scene_text}
<END OF EXCERPT>

Based on this excerpt and your knowledge of the movie, which of the following story beats does this scene fall under? Here are your choices:

{story_beats}

Your output value can only be either equal to or immediately greater than this story beat. For example, if the previous beat is "Exposition", then your story beat choice for this one can't be Climax. It must either be Exposition or Conflict. If the previous beat was "Conflict", then your story beat choice for this one can only be either Conflict or the next greatest value RISING_ACTION. This should make sense to you because you won't jump from skip one story beat from one to another; that's not how storytelling and screenplays work.

Keep in mind where we are in the story as far as scene number is concerned. Only return one value from the list. Here is the value from the previous story beat: {previous_story_beat}. 

Only output the single word value of the story beat you choose. Do not include any other text or punctuation. Do not include any explanation or reasoning. Do not include any quotes. Just return the single word value. Super critical: if you're unsure, simply return the previous story beat ({previous_story_beat}) rather than making a guess.
